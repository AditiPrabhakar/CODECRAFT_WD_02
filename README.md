# Stopwatch ⏱️
This is a simple and interactive Stopwatch Web App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to:

✅ Start & Stop the timer with a button.
✅ Record Lap Times to track intervals.
✅ Reset the timer and clear lap records.

The app features a minimalist design, smooth transitions, and real-time updates using JavaScript's setInterval(). It's a great project for practicing DOM manipulation, event handling, and time calculations in JavaScript. 🚀
